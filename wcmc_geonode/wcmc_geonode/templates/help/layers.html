  <h2>Layers</h2>
</div>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-8">
    <p>All GIS information is stored under the Layers label.</p>
    <h3 id="layer-browsing">Browsing and Searching</h3>
    <p>All layers can be browsed and searched by clicking on the <a href="/layers">Layers</a> tab. You will be able to filter results by Text, Type, Categories, Keywords, Owners, Date, Regions and Extent. All data can be downloaded in a variety of formats, for use in other applications.</p>
    <h3 id="adding-datasets">Adding Datasets</h3>
    <p>The process of uploading layers depends on if the data was produced in the centre or if it has external sources.</p>
    <p>The workflow on importing GIS datasets is described on the following diagrams both for produced internally data and externally sourced:</p>
    <table class="table" id="gis-sops">
      <thead>
        <tr class="c1">
          <th class="text-center">Produced Data</th>
          <th class="text-center">External Data</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr class="c1">
          <td class="text-center"><a href="{{ STATIC_URL }}img/produced_gis_data.png"><img src="{{ STATIC_URL }}img/produced_gis_data_thumb.png" /></a></td>
          <td class="text-center"><a href="{{ STATIC_URL }}img/external_gis_data.png"><img src="{{ STATIC_URL }}img/external_gis_data_thumb.png" /></a></td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>The workflow is similar but there are important differences:</p>
    <p>For external data the coordinate system may not been set. in that case you need to contact the Data Manager. For produced that it is the producer responsibility do define the Coordinate System</p>
    <p>The license to use depends on the source for external data and on you or the Data Champion of your programme for produced data.</p>
    <p> The steps are: Format Conversion, Coordinate System Setup , Renaming According to Naming Standards, Uploading Files, License and Permissions Management, Adding Metadata.</p>
    <h3 id="format-conversion">Format Conversion</h3>
    <p>The two standard data formats in UNEP-WCMC Geonode are Shapefiles for vector data and GeoTiff for raster data. If the original is in another format it should be converted. If you have any problems converting please contact the Data Manager.</p>
    <h3 id="cs-setup">Coordinate System Setup</h3>
    <p>If the coordinate system is not set you should search for information on this matter and set the right one in your favourite GIS desktop software. If after a deep search you cannot find the information please contact the Data Manager.</p>
    <h3 id="renaming">Renaming According to Standards</h3>
    <p>Before uploading the file you must check if both its name and its attribute table comply with UNEP-WCMC naming standards.</p>
    <h3 id="uploading-files">Uploading Files</h3>
    <p>Depending on the file size it can take some time to upload. While you wait you can set the permissions for the dataset.</p>
    <h3 id="license-management">License and Permissions Management</h3>
    <p>If you do not know which License to use please contact the Data Champion of your programme. If you already know which License applies to your data, you can set up the permissions on the right side of the page. If you think that License has not been used before in UNEP-WCMC you will also need to contact the Data Champion of your programme so he/she can add it to the Licenses list.</p>
    <h3 id="adding-metadata">Adding Metadata</h3>
    <p>This is the most important and also the most time-consuming task. Information about the different fields is provided when you mouseover each box.</p>
    <p>If there is other information about the dataset that might be relevant you should add as a document linked to this dataset. To do that fill in the metadata and then follow the instruction about adding documents to UNEP-WCMC Geonode</p>
